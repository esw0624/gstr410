      <h2>Patterns of Violence and Direct Action</h2>
      <h6>Examining the tactics that define Hilltop Youth activity in the West Bank.</h6>
      <p>
        The Hilltop Youth are widely recognized for their direct-action tactics and confrontational presence in the West Bank. 
        Although they lack a formal organizational structure, their activities consistently reflect patterns of settler-extremist behavior. 
        One of the group’s defining methods is the “price-tag” strategy, which involves retaliatory attacks against Palestinians or Israeli authorities following settlement demolitions or government actions they oppose. 
        According to the U.S. Department of the Treasury (2024), the Hilltop Youth have repeatedly attacked Palestinians and destroyed Palestinian homes and property in the West Bank, and have engaged in killings, 
        mass arson, and other “price tag” attacks intended to intimidate Palestinian civilians.
      </p>

      <p>
        These incidents commonly involve burning vehicles or buildings, vandalizing property, uprooting olive trees, and leaving threatening graffiti (U.S. Department of the Treasury, 2024). 
        Such actions demonstrate how the group uses symbolic and material violence to assert its presence and resistance. 
        Taken together, these activities reveal a persistent pattern of ideologically motivated settlement expansion, vigilante retaliation, and defiance of state authority. 
        Their behavior reflects a blend of religious nationalism and youth-driven rebellion, making their actions distinct from mainstream settler organizations while still significant enough to draw formal sanctions and international concern.

                  On July 31, 2015, a Palestinian family home in the West Bank

                  18-month-old Ali Dawabshe and fatally injured his parents. A
                  former Hilltop Youth member later described how extremist
                  settler cells carefully planned such attacks, conducted
                  surveillance of homes, and destroyed evidence to evade arrest
                  (Lewis, 2015).

                <p class="incident-card-text">
                  In November 2025, Israeli settlers allegedly set fire to the
                  Hajja Hamida Mosque in the village of Deir Istiya near Salfit,
                  burning parts of the prayer hall and damaging copies of the
                  Quran. Photographs from the scene showed racist anti-Palestinian
                  slogans sprayed on the mosque walls and charred religious
                  texts, prompting Palestinian officials to denounce the arson as
                  a “heinous crime” against a holy site in the occupied West Bank
                  (Al Jazeera, 2025).

                  Attacks on Palestinian Olive Harvesters, 2025
                </h4>

                <p class="incident-card-text">
                  During the 2025 olive harvest season, UN monitors documented
                  over 120 settler attacks across roughly 70 West Bank towns and
                  villages, including vandalism of more than 4,000 olive trees.
                  Al Jazeera reports that settlers torched Palestinian vehicles
                  in Deir Dibwan, seized harvested olives in Sinjil, and worked
                  alongside soldiers who declared agricultural land a “closed
                  military zone,” blocking farmers from their groves. These
                  measures deepen a long-standing pattern in which olive trees —
                  a key symbol of Palestinian land and identity — are destroyed
                  to pressure communities off their land (Al Jazeera, 2025).

                  US Sanctions “Hilltop Youth” as Violent Extremist Group
                </h4>

                <p class="incident-card-text">
                  In October 2024, the United States sanctioned “Hilltop Youth,”
                  treating the loosely organised settler activists as a violent
                  extremist group responsible for attacks on Palestinians and
                  clashes with Israeli security forces (Magid, 2024). The US
                  Treasury described Hilltop Youth as carrying out killings, mass
                  arson, and “price tag” rampages in towns such as al-Mughayyir
                  and Turmus Ayya, where homes, vehicles, and livestock were
                  torched and residents beaten. The move, alongside sanctions on
                  individual settler leaders, signals growing international
                  willingness to frame these networks as a serious source of
                  destabilisation in the West Bank.

                  Demolition of Hilltop Youth Outposts, 2020

                <p class="incident-card-text">
                  On January 15, 2020, Israeli forces demolished two illegal Hilltop Youth 
                  structures in the Kumi Ori outpost near Yitzhar. One of the homes belonged 
                  to Neria Zarog, a prominent Hilltop Youth activist who had previously been 
                  removed under an IDF administrative order. Over 450 Border Police officers 
                  and Civil Administration inspectors participated in the operation, which 
                  sparked clashes as settler youths threw stones at security forces. The 
                  demolition highlighted escalating tensions between extremist hilltop activists 
                  and the Israeli state, even as the government simultaneously approved new 
                  nature reserves across the West Bank (i24NEWS, 2020).

                  Settler Arson on Warehouse and Farmland, 2025
                </h4>

                <p class="incident-card-text">
                  In November 2025, BBC reporting documented a coordinated series of settler
                  attacks in the northern West Bank, including arson at a Palestinian warehouse
                  in Beit Lid where lorries were set on fire, as well as tents burned in the
                  Bedouin community of Deir Sharaf (Knell, 2025). The UN’s humanitarian office
                  noted that settler violence had reached its highest recorded levels since it
                  began tracking incidents in 2006, with hundreds of attacks in a single month.
                  During the same period, settlers also assaulted Palestinian olive harvesters,
                  Israeli activists, and journalists, including Reuters photographer Raneen
                  Sawafta, underscoring how Hilltop Youth–style networks target both local
                  communities and those who attempt to document or resist the violence.

                  Rehabilitating “Hilltop Youth” as At-Risk Teens, 2020
                </h4>

                <p class="incident-card-text">
                  A 2020 <em>Times of Israel</em> report profiles Etgar Beit El, an Education
                  Ministry–backed program that works primarily with Hilltop Youth as “at-risk
                  teens” rather than hardened criminals (Magid, 2020). Serving dozens of boys
                  who split their time between illegal West Bank outposts and makeshift
                  classrooms, the program combines Bagrut exam preparation with weekly
                  one-on-one social work support. Staff argue that many of these youths come
                  from traumatic or unstable homes and are drawn to the hilltops by a mix of
                  ideology, alienation from their communities, and lack of alternatives.
                  While security services continue to treat them as a national security
                  threat, Etgar Beit El seeks to redirect their energy toward education,
                  military or national service, and reintegration into wider Israeli society.
